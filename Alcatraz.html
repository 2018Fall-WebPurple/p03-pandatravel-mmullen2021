<p>The Alcatraz Island, a historic prison from the 1930s-1960s, is a very interesting and unforgettable haunted experience. The famous penitentiary held many infamous inmates such as Al "Scarface" Capone and "Birdman" Robert Stroud. The isolated island is off the coast of San Francisco, California.</p>

 <!--A blockquote describing Alcatraz-->   
<blockquote>Today, Alcatraz is a national landmark that gives tours of the jail, and cruises through the San Francisco Bay. Alcatraz also has many interesting pieces of history such as Civil War-era buildings, cannons, and subterranean rooms that give insight into the 19th century. As you dock at Alcatraz Island, visible reminders of the American Indian Occupation, which began in 1969 and ended in 1971, remains etched on “The Rock”, recognizing an important milestone in the American Indian rights movement. Alcatraz, an incredible attraction to visit with friends and family, will take you back in time to learn about this fascinating and spooky part in history.</blockquote>

<h2><center>Reviews:</center></h2>
<p>5/5 stars: A great boat trip over, and the narrated tour and audio tour were both very interesting and informative. A great way to spend a day, with a diverse giftshop too.</p>

<p>5/5 stars: The cruise across the bay at sunset gave the most spectacular views of San Fran and the Bridge and arriving on the island as the sun goes down was very atmospheric. </p>
    
<p>5/5 stars: This is an absolutely fantastic attraction. The staff are friendly, the attractions are great and informative and we as a group really enjoyed walking around and learning about a range of things. A definite must!
